      question: "Tell me about a time when you had to work under a tight deadline.",
      answer:
        "In my previous role, we had a client emergency that required a complete website redesign in just three days. I organized the team, prioritized critical features, and worked extended hours to deliver on time. The client was thrilled with the results, and we maintained the relationship.",
      difficulty: "medium",

      category: "behavioral",
      question: "Describe a situation where you had to resolve a conflict within your team.",
      answer:
        "Two team members had different approaches to a project, causing tension. I organized a meeting to let both present their ideas, facilitated a discussion of pros and cons, and helped the team reach a compromise that incorporated the best elements of both approaches. This improved team dynamics and led to a successful project.",
      difficulty: "medium",
    },
    {
      id: "bq3",
      category: "behavioral",
      question: "Tell me about a time when you failed at something and what you learned from it.",
      answer:
        "I once underestimated the complexity of a project and committed to an unrealistic deadline. We missed the deadline, disappointing the client. I learned to thoroughly assess project requirements, add buffer time for unexpected issues, and communicate more transparently about timelines. Since then, I've consistently met or exceeded expectations.",
      difficulty: "hard",
    },
    {
      id: "bq4",
      category: "behavioral",
      question: "Give an example of how you set goals and achieve them.",
      answer:
        "When I wanted to improve our team's code quality, I set a goal to reduce bugs by 30% in three months. I implemented code reviews, unit testing standards, and weekly quality metrics. By the end of the quarter, we had reduced bugs by 45% and improved deployment stability.",

      id: "bq5",
      category: "behavioral",
      question: "How do you handle working with people from different backgrounds?",
      answer:
        "In my last role, I worked with team members across three different countries. I made an effort to learn about their cultural norms, adjusted meeting times to accommodate different time zones, and created documentation that was accessible to non-native English speakers. This inclusive approach led to better collaboration and stronger relationships.",

      question: "Explain the difference between REST and GraphQL APIs.",
      answer:
        "REST APIs use multiple endpoints for different resources with fixed data structures, while GraphQL uses a single endpoint where clients can specify exactly what data they need. REST is simpler to implement and benefits from caching, while GraphQL reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data and gives clients more flexibility.",
      difficulty: "medium",
    },
    {
      id: "tq2",
      category: "technical",
      question: "How would you optimize a website's performance?",
      answer:
        "I would start by measuring current performance using tools like Lighthouse. Then I'd implement optimizations like: compressing images, implementing lazy loading, minifying CSS/JS, using a CDN, enabling browser caching, reducing third-party scripts, and implementing code splitting. After each change, I'd measure again to quantify improvements.",
      difficulty: "medium",
    },
    {
      id: "tq3",
      category: "technical",
      question: "Explain how you would design a scalable microservice architecture.",
      answer:
        "I'd design services around business domains, ensure loose coupling with well-defined APIs, implement service discovery and API gateways, use event-driven communication for asynchronous processes, implement circuit breakers for fault tolerance, containerize services with Kubernetes for orchestration, and set up comprehensive monitoring and distributed tracing.",
      difficulty: "hard",
    },
    {
      id: "tq4",
      category: "technical",
      question: "What is the difference between cookies, local storage, and session storage?",
      answer:
        "Cookies are small text files (4KB max) sent with HTTP requests, can have expiration dates, and are used for authentication. Local Storage provides 5-10MB of storage that persists indefinitely until cleared. Session Storage is similar to Local Storage but data is cleared when the browser session ends. Both storage options are only accessible on the client side.",

      question: "Explain the concept of Big O notation and give examples.",
      answer:
        "Big O notation describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of time or space as input size grows. O(1) is constant time (array access), O(log n) is logarithmic (binary search), O(n) is linear (simple loop), O(n log n) is linearithmic (efficient sorting algorithms), O(nÂ²) is quadratic (nested loops), and O(2^n) is exponential (recursive fibonacci). We aim for the lowest possible complexity.",

      question: "As a frontend developer, how do you approach responsive design?",
      answer:
        "I start with a mobile-first approach, using flexible grids and relative units (%, rem). I implement media queries at standard breakpoints, test on multiple devices, and use tools like Flexbox and CSS Grid for complex layouts. I also ensure accessibility across devices and use responsive images to optimize performance.",
      difficulty: "medium",
    },
    {
      id: "rq2",
      category: "roleSpecific",
      question: "How would you handle a situation where product requirements change mid-sprint?",
      answer:
        "I would first assess the impact on current work and timeline. For minor changes, I might accommodate them within the sprint. For significant changes, I'd discuss with the product manager to either defer the changes to the next sprint or re-prioritize current tasks. I'd ensure the team understands the changes and update documentation accordingly.",
      difficulty: "medium",
    },
    {
      id: "rq3",
      category: "roleSpecific",
      question: "Describe your experience with CI/CD pipelines.",
      answer:
        "I've set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins. These pipelines automated linting, testing, building, and deployment processes. For example, I implemented a pipeline that ran unit and integration tests on pull requests, deployed to staging on merge to develop, and to production on merge to main after manual approval. This reduced deployment errors by 70%.",
      difficulty: "hard",
    },
    {
      id: "rq4",
      category: "roleSpecific",
      question: "How do you stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies?",
      answer:
        "I follow industry leaders on Twitter and LinkedIn, subscribe to newsletters like JavaScript Weekly, read blogs from companies like Vercel and Netlify, participate in online communities like Dev.to and Stack Overflow, attend virtual conferences, take online courses, and work on side projects to experiment with new technologies.",
      difficulty: "easy",
    },
    {
      id: "rq5",
      category: "roleSpecific",
      question: "How would you architect a large-scale React application?",
      answer:
        "I'd organize by feature rather than type, use a state management solution like Redux for complex state, implement code splitting for performance, create a component library for consistency, use TypeScript for type safety, set up comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E), implement proper error boundaries, and use React Query or SWR for data fetching. I'd also consider using Next.js for SSR/SSG benefits.",
