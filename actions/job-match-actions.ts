      content: `Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Frontend Developer position at TechCorp. With over 5 years of experience in frontend development, specializing in React and TypeScript, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team.

Throughout my career, I have focused on building performant, accessible, and maintainable web applications. At my current role at WebTech Solutions, I led the development of a React-based dashboard that improved user engagement by 40% and reduced load times by 60%.

I was particularly excited to see that TechCorp is working on innovative cloud-based solutions for enterprise clients. My experience with optimizing web applications for enterprise use cases would allow me to contribute immediately to your projects.

I am confident that my technical skills, combined with my passion for creating exceptional user experiences, make me a strong candidate for this position. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills would benefit TechCorp.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of working with your team.

Sincerely,
John Doe`,
